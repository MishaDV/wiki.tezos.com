## Contact and Support

This page provides a comprehensive list of the best resources for support
within the Tezos community. Always beware of those impersonating Tezos admins
and community members.

Please Note: A general best practice for getting support with any technical issue is to make sure the exchange takes place publicly on an open platform.   
  
Note: Tezos is a decentralized project and ecosystem, there is no 'official' support.
